Interlinear text of Salute Jonathan story

Salute Jonathan is a story taken from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Salute,_Jonathan! fashioned in the style of interlinear text. 
The original text has been designed to not require a translation (by the "Nature Method"), but for those who prefer an interlinear version, there is this one. 

Running index.php will build the json required for the translation. Running /duo-text/index.html will run the interlinear page.
